 * This function handles the complex flow of signing users in, and either creating,
 * linking (or not linking) accounts depending on if the user is currently logged
 * in, if they have account already and the authentication mechanism they are using.
 *
 * It prevents insecure behaviour, such as linking OAuth accounts unless a user is
 * signed in and authenticated with an existing valid account.
 *
 * All verification (e.g. OAuth flows or email address verificaiton flows) are
 * done prior to this handler being called to avoid additonal complexity in this
 * handler.
